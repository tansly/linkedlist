# linkedlist
This is the code I have written to practice pointers etc during my first few months in C programming. This is solely for educational purposes, and does not show the best practices. I am publishing this to archive my work with the hope that it may help other newcomers to C. But I advise not to use it as an example of good code. Although I am pretty sure that it does not have critical bugs, it is bad code in many aspects. It is sometimes commented, sometimes not. I hope that it is somehow readable.

I put the test routines in the test.c file and the functions which manipulate the lists in the list.c file. Just a 'make' is enough to compile it. It also creates a tags file. (make sure you have ctags installed)
